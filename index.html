    <h2> Q&A: Get To Know Charlie</h2>

    <ul>

      <li class = "bold"> What is it like to have a rescue dog?</li>
      <p class = "normal"> It is pretty diffucilt. We have all fallen a victim to Charlie's poor behavior. Lots of money spent on trainers! He's a loving dog, but only to a few so we are glad to not be on his bad side!</p>
      <li class = "bold"> Where was he rescued from?</li>
      <p class = "normal"> We actually don't know too much information! We do know that if he wasn't rescued, he would have been sent to a kill shelter:(</p>
      <li class = "bold"> Who is his favorite?</li>
      <p class = "normal"> For sure my mom & I. My mom takes the first place trophy, but silver isn't too bad right? </p>
